# sisyphus

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sisyphus is to rerun to allow to rerun tests every time you change a file in your R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sisyphus like so:

``` r
pak::pak("thinkr-open/sisyphus")
```

## Example

Run `testthat::test_local` every time you change a file in the `R/` & `tests` directories:

```r
sisyphus::sisyphus_run()
```

The default params to this function are:

- `check_fun`: The function launched every time a file change, by default `testthat::test_local()`

- `delay`: The check for modification is done every 1 second

- `func_files_to_watch`: A fuction that return the files to watch: by default `sisyphus::sisyphus_get_r_and_tests`, that outputs the content  of `R/` & `tests/`

- `func_files_to_ignore`: A fuction that return the files to ignore :by default `sisyphus::sisyphus_get_testthat_snaps`, that outputs the content  of `tests/testthat/_snaps`, as snaps are modified every time a test is run, creating an infinite loop if ever you watch them.


You can change these settings by passing arguments to the function:

```r
sisyphus::sisyphus_run(
  check_fun = \(){
    print(covr::package_coverage())
  },
  delay = 0.5
  ,
  fun_files_to_watch = \(){
    list.files(
      here::here(),
      recursive = TRUE,
      full.names = TRUE
    )
  }
)
```

To stop the check, run `sisyphus::sisyphus_stop()`.

To change the config of the checks while the loop is running, you can use:

- `sisyphus_change_delay()`
- `sisyphus_change_check_fun()`
- `sisyphus_change_fun_files_to_watch()`
- `sisyphus_change_fun_files_to_ignore()`

## Common Pitfalls

- If not in RStudio, the printing to the console is not correct, and it looks like you don't have a terminal again. But you do have one, press Enter to get it back.

- If you don't have a test infrastructure, you will get the following error:

```r
Error in `test_dir()`:
! No test files found
```

Run `usethis::use_testthat()` to create a test infrastructure.

- Using `devtools::check` will not fully print the output to the console but you'll get the error list.


- `sisyphus::sisyphus_stop()` throws an error when the asynchronous loop it uses is already destroyed.

```r
> sisyphus::sisyphus_stop()
Error: Expecting a single value: [extent=0].
```

## Check function suggestions

Here is a list of some functions that can  be used to check:

```r
sisyphus::sisyphus_run(
  check_fun = \() {
    withr::with_envvar(
      c("NOT_CRAN" = TRUE),{
        cli::cli_alert_info("Running covr::report()...")
        covr::report()
        cli::cat_rule("")
      }
    )
  }
)
```
